# Neural Encoding Models

A set of python modules for fitting, testing, and visualizing parameters of neural encoding models (NEMs).

Neural encoding models are models that try and predict neural activity given a stimulus. For example, we can fit models to predict the spiking activity of neurons in the retina or V1 in response to a visual stimulus displayed on a computer monitor.

Here, we include general tools that allow you to fit the parameters of encoding models of any functional form. Additionally, we provide specific classes to fit linear-nonlinear (LN) and cascaded (2-layer) linear-nonlinear (LN-LN) models to data.
