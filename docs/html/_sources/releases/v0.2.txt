v0.2 (Work in Progress)
=======================

Work in progress. Major focus: add a separate ``objectives`` that lets you plug and play different kinds of noise models,
such as gaussian (mean squared error) or poisson.

API Changes
-----------
- Added an LN model class that uses a gaussian log-likelihood (mean squared error)
- Added a function ``print_test_results`` to ``NeuralEncodingModel``
- Added the ``tableprint`` module as a dependency

Roadmap
-------
- Add the ability to change the final nonlinearity in the ``LNLN`` model class
- Add common loss functions and gradients in ``objectives.py``
- Build some simple LN and LNLN simulations in ``simulate.py``
- Write some tests where we recover simulated model parameters
