v0.3 (Work in progress)
=======================

Current focus: adding a separate ``objectives`` that lets you plug and play different kinds of noise models,
such as gaussian (mean squared error) or poisson.

New Features
------------
- Information about algorithm convergence is stored in two data frames, ``models.metadata`` and ``models.convergence``. The first stores the primal and dual residuals and runtimes for each leg of the alternating minimization, and the second stores metrics evaluated on held out data at each alternating iteration.

API Changes
-----------
- Moved helper functions to a separate module, contained in ``utilities.py``
